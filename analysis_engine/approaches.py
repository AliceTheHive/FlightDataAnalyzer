class ApproachInformation(ApproachNode):
    """
    # TODO: Update docstring for ApproachNode.

    Details of all approaches that were made including landing.

    If possible we attempt to determine the airport and runway associated with
    each approach.

    We also attempt to determine an approach type which may be one of the
    following:

    - Landing
    - Touch & Go
    - Go Around

    The date and time at the start and end of the approach is also determined.

    When determining the airport and runway, we use the heading, latitude and
    longitude at:

    a. landing for landing approaches, and
    b. the lowest point on the approach for any other approaches.

    If we are unable to determine the airport and runway for a landing
    approach, it is also possible to fall back to the achieved flight record.

    A list of approach details are returned in the following format::
