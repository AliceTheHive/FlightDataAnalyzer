Key Point Value (KPV)
=====================

-----------
Description
-----------

A Key Point Value is a **Value** of interest measured at a point during a
flight. The key attribute of a KPV is the **value** which represents a
measured value at a point in the flight.

A point can be a single instance or the start of a slice eg. duration. 

The number of KPV's generated by a KPV node will vary depending on a number
of factors, there may be between 0 and many instances;

* a KPV will not get created due to the conditions not being triggered
 
 eg. AltitudeAtGearUpSelectionDuringGoAround will only be detected on flights
 where a Go Around occurs. 
 
* A KPV will also not get created if the frame for an aircraft does not record a required parameter for the KPV to operate.
* Multiple KPV's will get created if the conditions of the KPV are met multiple times during a flight.
 
 eg. AltitudeAtGearDownSelection will create KPV's for every occurance of Gear Down transitioning to 'Down'
 
* formatted name nodes can be used to avoid duplication of closly related KPV's
 
 eg. AirspeedWithFlapMax is a single node which will create KPV's for each flap detent applicable to the aircraft.

Benefits
--------

 * ensures a consistent measurement technique is employed accros all aircraft
 * allows direct comparisons(not dependent on thresolds/limits)
 * can be used to detect events with the use of thresolds/limits
 * distributions/histograms

Example
-------

A simple example of a Key Point Value is AltitudeMax, The maximum altitude
during the flight.

Here is the code for AltitudeMax::

    class AltitudeMax(KeyPointValueNode):
        '''
        Maximum Altitude STD
        '''
    
        units = 'ft'
    
        def derive(self,
                   alt_std=P('Altitude STD Smoothed'),
                   airborne=S('Airborne')):
    
            self.create_kpvs_within_slices(alt_std.array, airborne, max_value)

AltitudeMax has no can_operate defined so both "Altitude STD Smoothed" and
"Airborne" sections are required for AltitudeMax to run.
to return max value, prevents data spikes whilst on the
ground. aligned to Altitude STD Smoothed. uses create_kpvs_within_slices.
resulting Key Point Value in feet ("ft")
